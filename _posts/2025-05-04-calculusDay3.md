Apologies for the long delay of over a month. I was focusing on other subjects at College that I have forgotten to jot down a reflection here in my personal blog. So let's continue where we have left off.

## Reviewing of last day's class
Before my lecturer starts off today's material. We went on a short review of what we have just learnt last week about derivative, along with some extra points he added. This is where the familar formula I've known since High School is mentioned. So basically this formula of _f'(x) = n*ax^(n-1)_ is a simplified version of the original formula as shown in the thumbnail of this post. After that short review, we were given some questions to practice with and a short homework.

## Brief introduction to Chains rule
Unfortunately, while he had planned to introduce to Chains rule, it was't maximum due to time contraints. So, he left us with a little work related to Chains rule just to get an idea of how Chains rule actuall work. After doing some questions, I found it to be slightly complex, but I was able to recall this specific material after I skimmed over my past notebooks from High School. So, moral of the lesson? Keep your notebacks from High School, since it might come in handy, which is true in this case.
