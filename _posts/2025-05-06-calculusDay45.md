## Finishing some remaining assignments

The last day before the first exam was, as the header says, just finishing up assignments if there are any left. Thus, I finished it all and the rest of this day was just some brief explanation on how the exam was going to be. It was pretty straightforward to understand. Though, the class did not end without some additional material the lecturer taught us about:
* Determining if a function's input is the minimum or maximum type
* Finding the extreme point of a function
* How input can affect the function's shape when we put it in [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator), or just the actual function itself
