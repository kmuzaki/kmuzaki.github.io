## End of Support for Windows 10

From the initial release of Windows 10 back in 2015 until today as of me writing this post, I believe we can all agree that it has been quite a journey for us using Windows 10. An [Operating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) made by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) that we all thought to be the last version of Windows until the end of time where the initial plan would be to continously pushing out patches and updates throught its runtime.

That is until on the 24th of June 2021 where they dropped an introduction to [Windows 11](https://news.microsoft.com/june-24-2021/?msockid=394d217fcc2a6ee220d735a0cd1f6fab). An all brand new OS from Microsoft which to no surprise garnared a rather mixed reception at first, even to this day, especially with some privacy concerns due to [Copilot's new "Recall" feature](https://windowsreport.com/recall-may-take-snapshots-of-sensitive-information-but-microsoft-says-youll-be-fine/) and other requirements that aren't accessible to most casual computer users, like having [TPM 2.0](https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/what-is-a-tpm-and-why-do-i-need-one-for-windows-11) for example. But ultimately as time goes on, it is steadily become a much better operating system.

However, this comes at the cost of Microsoft announcing that they will [stop supporting Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-of-support?msockid=394d217fcc2a6ee220d735a0cd1f6fab) on October 14 2025. Meaning that after the date has passed, Microsoft will no longer releasing updates and general support for Windows 10. Outside of critical security updates like how they do with Windows 7 and Windows 8, hopefully.

## Why I stick to Windows 10?

It is true that I will inevitably say goodbye to Win10 and say hello to Win11. In fact, my computer has meet its requirements like TPM 2.0, 12 gigs of ram, etc. But despite that, I sticked to Windows 10 for a while and I'll keep doing it until Microsoft finally pull the plug. 

So why then? Well there are a couple reasons, but most prominently is that why do I need to rush? Why do I REALLY need to upgrade to Windows 11 when Microsoft still support Windows 10? Sure they'll stop supporting it, but I could still download updates and patches to improve security and features. In fact, it is said that Microsoft realise that Windows 10 still popular amongst PC users so they decided to improve user experience for Windows 10

Plus the fact that Windows 11 consumes more RAM to work with, so definitely a point for me to save some resources to run my applications. Also Windows 10 are still accessible to pretty much everyone across the board. So with that said, to those who are still sticking around, let's enjoy these last few months before we finally move on to Windows 11...
