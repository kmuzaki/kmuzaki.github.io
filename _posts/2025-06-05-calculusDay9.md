## Integral with Substitution
Of course, when we want to solve integral problems, it's not always going to be a straight forward function, like _f(x) = (x^3) + 2_. At times, you'll encounter a more complex functions you'll see later. Thus, in this class I learned about Integral with substitution. In a way, it's similar with the chains rule when we try to find a function's derivative.

_Integral With Substitution_

I'll try my best to explain it by words. Based on the image above, we were given a function of: 
>_Integral (((x^3)+2)^20) 5x^2 dx_

From there, we take the "inner" part of the function, which is _(x^3)+2_ and find its derivative first. After that we turn that into fraction to adapt with the symbols of "dx" and "du" (correct me if I'm wrong.) Then, we substitute that into the main function, and from there we integrate it as normal. Full details can be seen in the image above.

## Definite Integral
Definite Integral is an integral that has a start and end values, or interval. Which means there is an interval in the area of the function's graph. These start and end values are put on the bottom and the top of the Integral symbol "S".

_Difference between definite and indefinite Integral_

The way we solve is just like how solve an indefinite integral as normal. But after we got its integrated function, we then substitute it with the top values and the bottom values, calculate it, and then subtract the value of the integrated function substituted with the top value, with that same integrated function's value but substituted with the bottom value and we finally get the end result.

## Multiple Integral
Another thing we have learned during this day is multiple Integral. It's where we try to find the total value of an area that is being marked. Especially when the limit go from negative to positive. The steps were:
1. Understand the region first
2. Split the limit into two parts (For example if the limit is -1 and 4, then we need to do the integral twice. With limit -1 to 0 first, then 0 to 4.)
3. Do both integral as usual. With the integral that have negative limit value, make the result absolute.
4. Sum up both integral results and done!
