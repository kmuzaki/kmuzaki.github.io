## Introduction to The Riemann Sums

After the exam last week has finished, we started to learn about Integral. But before we delve into that, we were introduced first to Riemann Sums. While this may sound pointless, since my lecturer said that it won't be included for the next exam, it is still considerable interesting to learn.

## Quick history of Riemann Sums

Riemann Sums, which lead to the concept of integral, starts all the way back when
people have a hard time calculating the space of land in a country. Yes, we can calculate the space of let's say a square, or a triangle, a circle, trapezoid, etc. But in reality, all countries aren't shaped like that. The closest shape is a circle, but even then, it won't be a perfect circle.

Hence why a person named Riemann decided to make a formula to roughly calculate the space of a country's land. Riemann sums, to my understanding, works by repeatedly calculate the sum of this formula:
> Sigma N (h * f(a+i*h))

It's a bit confusing by words, but when we put it in a graph, it will make sense. The more segment we use, the more accurate the result be, but it won't reach full 100% accuracy. Since as we established earlier, all countries aren't shaped like a typical shapes we've come to learn since elementary.

## Short assignment

After this brief introduction, we were givin a short task to fill out a table in the following image. It looked complex at first, which is exactly the same thing I said to other assignments at College, but here's the fun part. My lecturer allowed us to solve it however we want, and yes, that includes writing our own Java program to solve it. I chose that way.
