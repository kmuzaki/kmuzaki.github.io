# Text-based escape room

One of the most interesting assignments that I've worked on during my first semester. A text-based escape room game on Python. This simple game only consists of 3 levels and the puzzles are straightforward. However, this assignment highlights everything I've learned so far at the time regarding Python, including the use of classes, functions, nested conditional statements, dictionary, and more.

The game is made up of 760 lines and using the colorama, time, and pprint libraries to enhance the game's presentation and interactivity for the player. Technically, the game's code is far from perfect and there is a lot of room for improvement, but it is still an impressive work.
