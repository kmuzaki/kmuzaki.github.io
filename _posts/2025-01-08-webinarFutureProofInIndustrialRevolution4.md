There is no doubt that during this era, we're seeing rapid advances in the technology space. Including the introduction of hundreds upon hundres of AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), Microsoft's [Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/personal-ai-assistant?msockid=394d217fcc2a6ee220d735a0cd1f6fab), Google's [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), and many many more. Not to mention that competition in the industry is increasingly tight, and with more and more companies implement AI Tools into the picture, it dramatically changes the pattern in the whole workforce, making those who can't catch up with the latest AI tools to make their work much more efficient to be irrelevant. In fact, some jobs might be outright replaced with AI.

Hence why 4 days ago, on the 4th of January this year, I joined a webinar that was held by [*Direktorat Pengembangan Inovasi Bisnis PPI Dunia*](https://www.instagram.com/inbis.ppidunia/) which discussed about some skills that are mandatory for us to have to stay relevant during this fourth Industrial Industry. It touched some topics like data analysis, AI technologies and the ability to collaborate with others, especially in an organization. 

## The Webinar
### Who was the speaker?

The speaker in the webinar was [Imam Kautsar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iKautzar/). He was Ph.D. Student in the Brunei Darussalam University and the founder of [Uptimatic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/uptimatic/) company. During the webinar, I found him to be an easy-going person and cracked a few intellectual jokes here and there. Not every time, but just a bit of jokes along the way. He was inspiring to a lot of participants in the webinar including myself.

### The discussion

What I have learned in the webinar, at least in some parts, was inline in what I was taught during my matriculation classes at College. AI has made a huge impact in the industry, like for example what used to be physical work now can be done at home with the implementation of AI, like call centres are replaced with AI, some restaurants in Japan are now replaced with robotics, etc. And it's not just going to impact those who are in the industry, but also those who are still learning or  outsiders to the technology industry.

In short the skills that we need to have are **collaboration, adaptibility, Master new technologies, and resilience**. How to develop these skills? First, you could join trainings and oher seminars, not just this one to gain more insights and knowledge regarding the latest trend in the digital business. Secondly, practice with real life projects. Thirdly, is to read some books, journals, literature. And last and certainly not least, improve our communication skills to collaborate with others.
