In this series of posts moving on, I'll recount what I've learned from my Calculus class at College. Some of these posts will mostly be quick and short depending on the depth of the topic being discussed during the class, how I quickly grasp on, and some other factors.

## Introduction to Limit and Derivatives

Limit and derivatives, when I first heard that term I thought it's going to be complex. Turns out, it's the exact same material that I've learned back in High School, at 11th grade to be exact. Just in English language this time. Though I imagined that it's gonna go more in-depth than last time.

Unfortunately during this particular class, I had a terrible headache that I couldn't pay attention to what my lecturer said. So apologies if I got some parts of my explanation wrong. From what I've learned and could process while having a headache, limit is sort of a approach concept of how a function approaching certain point depending on the input given to said function. We use limit to describe the characteristic of a function, as the argument approaches a point, or infinity, or the properties of a sequence as the index approaches infinity. Limit is used in calculus to determine the derivatives of certain function. The image you see in the thumbnail describes the limit formula.

That is all for my reflection regarding my first day in Calculus class
