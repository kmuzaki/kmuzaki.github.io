## Integral with Substitution
Of course, when we want to solve integral problems, it's not always going to be a straight forward function, like _f(x) = (x^3) + 2_. At times, you'll encounter a more complex functions you'll see later. Thus, in this class I learned about Integral with substitution. In a way, it's similar with the chains rule when we try to find a function's derivative.

_Integral With Substitution_

I'll try my best to explain it by words. Based on the image above, we were given a function of: 
>_Integral (((x^3)+2)^20) 5x^2 dx_

From there, we take the "inner" part of the function, which is _(x^3)+2_ and find its derivative first. After that we turn that into fraction to adapt with the symbols of "dx" and "du" (correct me if I'm wrong.)

Then, we substitute that into the main function, and from there we integrate it as normal. Full details can be seen in the image above.
