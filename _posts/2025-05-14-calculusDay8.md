While personally, I suspect that he was correct, just that he gave us a different variant of said Riemann Sums formula. That aside, after the review has done, we started to be introduced to Integral. Though personally, again, this is more so a **reintroduction** for me to this material, since I've learned this previously when I was in high school. Thus, I was able to skim my old notebook to refresh my memory while also open to this class.
