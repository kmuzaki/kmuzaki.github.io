# Manga to read??

One week in so far during my holiday. It is quite a fantastic time to relax while also continuing my personal projects and stuff for the upcoming competition next year at my Campus.

Though things got interesting when my lecturer in Computer Architecture subject gave out a Manga? And not just any Manga, an Manga about microprocessors in our Computers. As much as how weird it sounds, I find it to be interesting to give a read and to reinforce some of the stuff I've learned about Computer Architecture. A clever and creative way at that!
