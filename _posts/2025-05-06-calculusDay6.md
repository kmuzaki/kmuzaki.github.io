## The exam

On this particular, we were doing our first calculus exam regarding what we have learned about limit and derivatives. We were given a considerably amount of time to study and review everything. The exam itself consisted of around 5 to 10 questions after taking all the sub-questions into account. Thankfully, it was an **open notebook** exam, so it made things more easier. However, it didn't take away the actual difficulty of the questions themselves, since we needed to analyse them thoroughly. Fortunately, I got a good score of 93 with one or two minor mistakes I made in the exam, and my lecturer was kind to give me feedback on what I got wrong.
