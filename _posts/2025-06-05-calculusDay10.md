## Materials to study
On this day in particular, there were no new assignments being given here. Instead, we were given some questions to answer and study for exam next week. These questions ranging from find the integral value of certain function, to double integral. All ranging in complexity. While it was somewhat easy to understand for the most part, it was still a challenge to answer them all.
