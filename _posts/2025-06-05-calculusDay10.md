## Materials to study
On this day in particular, there were no new assignments being given here. Instead, we were given some questions to answer and study for the 2nd exam next week. These questions ranging from find the integral value of certain function, to double integral. All ranging in complexity. While it was somewhat easy to understand for the most part, it was still a challenge to answer them all. Fortunatele, I have my friends to rely on as someone who I could ask with when I was confused with some questions. In fact, the day before the exam, we were studying together online in Google meet!

_Question 5_

Question 5 as seen on the last image above was different and thankfully our lecture taught us how to solve it, since he didn't cover it in our class last week. In question 5, we had to deal with two functions instead of one, and have to find the value of the marked area in the graph by integrate it. This is called _double integral_. A double integral lets you find the total of something (like area, volume, or mass) over a 2D region. Itâ€™s like adding up tiny pieces across a surface.

The steps are:
1. Understand the region first
2. Pick the order of integration
3. Integrate the inside part first
4. Then do the outer integral as normal
