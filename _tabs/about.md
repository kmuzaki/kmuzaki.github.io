Hello and welcome to my personal blog. Hope you're having a good day. Allow me to Introduce myself. My name is Keihan Pradika Muzaki. I'm a student at Universitas Ciputra Makassar who is now in his first semester of his study in Informatics. I'm currently studying Python and make simple apps in Python itself and I look forward for my next projects to come.

As for my personal life, when I'm not studying my hobbies are playing video games and listening to music. You could say that I have an interesting taste of music like jazz, orchestra, and rock genre sometimes, though I most of the time don't follow the current music trend.
